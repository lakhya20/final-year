# inflation research classifier

> ⚠️ this is a final year academic project, not production software. the models were trained on a limited dataset and have not been fine-tuned for real-world use. do not use this for any production or research-critical purpose. predictions may be inaccurate.

a full-stack app that classifies academic abstracts as relevant or not relevant to inflation research, using a set of trained ml models.

## what it does

- classifies research abstracts using 5 models: logistic regression, svm, random forest, xgboost, and sbert+lr
- returns an ensemble verdict with per-model confidence scores
- finds semantically similar papers from the dataset using sbert embeddings
- provides bibliometric analysis: top keywords, authors, publication trends, bigrams
- visualises lda topic clusters discovered from the corpus

## stack

- **backend** - fastapi, scikit-learn, xgboost, sentence-transformers
- **frontend** - next.js 14, shadcn/ui, tailwind css, recharts
